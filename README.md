## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Learning JavaScript. The hardest part for me is to start on a blank js-file. Just learning how to think around JavaScript and trying to take it step by step. 

### Continued development

I have to write a lot of code to improve - especially JavaScript. Just keep coding to get better.
